Have you ever had the problem of deciding what to eat everyday? To ask your familiy or loved ones what they feel like eating to be met with an "I don't know" or worse, "I don't care" only to be met with complaints of eating leftovers or the same 5 recipes you know how to cook? No? Just me? ... Well that's where "Hey what are we eating today?" comes in. I have compiled my favorite lunch/dinner recipes with tutorials in one convenient place, and I no longer have a problem of deciding what to cook for the family. Buen provecho!
